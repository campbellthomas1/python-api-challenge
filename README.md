# python-api-challenge

## In this challenge I  created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. I took two APIs and found data using those APIs. I then made some visuals to help understand the data. I also made linear regression equations for many of the scatterpliots to help visualize the trend of the data as well.

## In the Weatherpy code I found
- Latitude vs. Temperature
- Latitude vs. Humidity
- Latitude vs. Cloudiness
- Latitude vs. Wind Speed
- Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude, Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude, Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude, Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude, Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

## In the Vacationpy code I found
- The max and min temperature that I wanted
- The ideal wind speed
- How much cloudiness T wanted
- Hotel names within 10000 meters of the locations I found ideal
- A map that displays a point in every city that is ideal
